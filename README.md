Thanks to _laserman_ for scripts to process airport data files into groundnets (https://github.com/mherweg/d-laser-fgtools)!  
A huge thanks goes to _SurferTim_ via the FlightGear forums (forum.flightgear.org) for a tool to edit HGT files (https://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=36077&start=90#p359458) and his work on editing the HGT file including TFFJ to fit real life data and imagery. Also, thanks to him for providing a nav.dat file to enable ILS approaches at TFFR (https://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=36077&p=359787#p359779).

##How can I help?
There are two areas in which everyone can contribute quite easily.
You can either improve airports using the World Editor (WED). See https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/worldeditor/ for more information.
Also, improving the available landcover data by contributing to OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org) helps improving this scenery a lot.
Thank you!
